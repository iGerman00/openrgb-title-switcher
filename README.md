# openrgb-title-switcher

This will switch the profile in OpenRGB based on window titles. It ignores any window titles that are not in the `target_names` array. It will attempt to switch to the profile with the same name as the window title. You can also enable default profile switching for it to switch to a single profile every time there is no profile for your current window.
